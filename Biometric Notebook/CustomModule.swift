// Module used to capture text based information based on a variable & its options. When we store this information to CoreData, we create a dictionary containing all necessary information & pass this to the managed object. When the app is reopened, this dictionary is broken down to produce individual components, which will be used for data capture.

class CustomModule: Module {
    
    private var prompt: String? //the (optional) prompt attached to the variable (replaces the variable's name as the section header of the TV for data collection)
    private let options: [String] //array of options associated w/ the variable/prompt
    static let configurations: [String] = ["Boolean"] //instance variable containing pre-defined configurations that can be attached to the module (e.g. the 'Boolean' attachment automatically creates 2 options, 'Yes' & 'No'
    
    init(name: String, options: [String]) { //initializer if user did not select a prompt
        self.options = options
        super.init(name: name)

    internal func createDictionaryForCoreDataStore() -> Dictionary<String, AnyObject> { //generates dictionary to be saved by CoreData (this dict will allow full reconstruction of the object). Each variable will occupy 1 spot in the overall dictionary, so we need to merge these individual dictionaries for each variable into 1 master dictionary. Each variable's dictionary will be indicated by the variable name, so MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO REPEAT NAMES!
