    //Functions implementing callbacks, as the following function does, take a FUNC as an ARGUMENT (the closure)! Essentially, the closure is a function being used as an input parameter to the current function being called. That function has an input & return type, like any other function does. Our closure has a dictionary input type, and returns VOID. This might seem counterintuitive - in our downloadJSON function, we want to RETURN a dictionary, not input it as a parameter. This is where the idea of a callback comes in - we don't want to return the dictionary, b/c this will block the main thread until the return is complete. Instead, we call a function that the person calling the downloadJSON function has given us & provide the associated arguments: this means that the callback/closure is ONLY defined when the function is called in the code, not when it is defined (as we are doing below). Go to the 'NetworkOperation' file to see what happens when the code is called.

        //The forecast API returns JSON data formatted as a dictionary, so we are choosing to return the data as a dictionary. The parameter in this closure - the dictionary - will be populated AFTER the 'download' method has been performed with the JSON data from the API! Thus, the completion handler RETURNS a JSON DICT!
