// Define the functions that all datastream subclasses draw upon - a stream variable occupes 1 location in the measurement cycle (like any other variable) & can be mixed w/ other variables @ the same location. However, UNLIKE other variables, the single variable can report MULTIPLE times @ a SINGLE location.
// When the user enters DataEntry mode for a stream variable, the system checks if the stream is currently open or closed. If OPEN, the system automatically presents the next location w/in the stream. If CLOSED, the user has the option to either open a new stream or use cached data from an old one.
